They have to be handed in by the end of Sunday of that week. The exercises are then presented to your tutor in a small feedback session. To acquire the admission for the final exam, you will have to pass $N-2$ of the weekly provided exercise sheets.\n",

To be able to run these on your system, you will need to install Python and a few packages. We suggest the newest version of Python 3 and installing the conda environment as explained in the practice session and in the file \"ml-install.txt\" (found on Stud.IP in the \"Documents\" section in the Folder \"Exercises\". This was also part of Sheet 00).\n",

In case you cannot do this first sheet (due to technical or organizational problems) please upload a description of your problem instead. Your tutor will help you to solve the problems in the first feedback session and you may hand in this sheet together with the second sheet one week later."

    "Now let's get to real fun part: Programming our first machine learning algorithm!\n",

    "But first some general remarks on coding style:\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, try to write code that's consistent with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the offical Python Style Guide. Have a look a the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as well. It's based on PEP8 and has some nice examples. As a bonus always document your function and classes with docstrings. It is best practice to stick to some docstring convention for example [Google's](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). This has the big advantages that it allows for automated generation of documentation. We will follow that convention in the code we provide you, so you know what kind of objects to expect and what to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, during the programming tasks, you run into a `NameError`, make sure that you executed all prior code cells beforehand. Later cells might rely on variables and function from prior cells. To see all currently defined variables you can make use of the `%whos` [magic function](https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki/IPython-'magic'-function-documentation#whos) anywhere in code cells. Additionally, it is sometimes handy to run all cells from the beginning by opeining the command palette typing `run all cells`. Moreover, using <kbd>b</kbd> to add new cells below and <kbd>a</kbd> for adding new cells above your current cell will make your life often easier. Finally, using <kbd>l</kbd>  to show line numbers is helpful for locating errors from error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Python code we have provided the building blocks for the `CANDIDATE-ELIMINATION` algorithm and put them together in a single function. Now you have to fill those building blocks with actual code. There are places marked with \n",
